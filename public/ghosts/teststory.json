You can't quite recognise the place, whose noise and light are all you know it by.</p><p>But that was the QCA you first got to know, that day back in June: lifeless and dark, as if it had been abandoned. A pillar stood in the lobby, wearing a forbiddingly thick armour of advertisements, a library of experiences unlived; it gave off the distinct air of being the birthplace of countless events and memories, yet there was no one there to speak to them.</p><p>Nothing here, you began to realise, would make sense in quite the way you wanted it to. This city's lexicon for reality is slightly different from your own, and in your language it all translates to one thing: <i>you are far away from everything you know.</i></p>"
