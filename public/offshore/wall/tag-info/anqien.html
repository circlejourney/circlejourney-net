<h2 class="tag-info-title">Anqien</h2>
<ul class="tag-info-list">
    <li>Full name: Liu Anqien, 刘安潜</li>
    <li>Age: 25</li>
    <li>Pronouns: they/them</li>
    <li>Birthplace: Joutien, Helfi</li>
</ul>

<p>Anqien has a will like water: they flow around hard obstacles and make way for what doesn't yield, but they have a patience and commitment to their dreams that lets them carve out the world they desire. Agreeable and rather spacey (in the "doesn't notice when there's a boom flying towards their head" sense), they bring positive energy and a can-do attitude to their team.</p>

<p>Anqien grew up near Wulien, where competitive sailing is always in. But their family made them ignore their wishes to explore it, in favour of a safe, less fanciful future. After discovering unexpected success in their university's sailing club and being offered a chance to join the Cloud Connectors team, they quit university to pursue it in full.</p>

<p>In the past 4 years, Anqien has made lots of progress, despite their parents' unsubtle wishes for them to quit the sport. Even then, they believe they're underperforming, and habitually look to Jinai as their superior. They sometimes worry they’re not meeting her skill level and are dragging the team down.</p>

<p>Despite being easily overwhelmed by attention and praise, Anqien is actually quite sociable, the sort to go wild at parties (where no one would judge them). They're often told that they're the most tolerant person in the world, but they do lose patience at some things, like their parents', and occasionally Jinai's, ruinous stubbornness.</p>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul class="tag-info-list">
<li>I associate Anqien with bottlenose dolphins, shades of turquoise and refracted light through shallow water.</li>
<li>The "q" in their name is pronounced with a sort of sharp "ch" sound (as in hanyu pinyin). The name loosely translates to "peaceful and submerged / hidden".</li>
<li>Anqien's family owns a hairdressing business that they run out of their home. They have a sister who helps dye their hair.</li>
<li>Anqien is demi/pansexual and demi/panromantic. They've had three romantic flings but none of them really felt right.</li>
<li>Their gender is basically "both and yet neither". They've probably gone by all three most common pronoun sets at some point in their life, but they/them is their favourite.</li>
