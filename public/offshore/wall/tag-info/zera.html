<h2 class="tag-info-title">Zera</h2>
<ul class="tag-info-list">
    <li>Full name: Zera Sastra</li>
    <li>Age: 21</li>
    <li>Pronouns: she/her</li>
    <li>Birthplace: Oriens, Sonora</li>
</ul>

<p>Zera knows what she wants and does what she must to get it. She's serious and put-together, especially in public. Fond of goth aesthetics and a little too enthusiastic about the concept of death, she's usually the one lurking like a shadow in the corner, dressed in monochromatic blacks, whites and greys.</p>

<p>As a sailor, Zera is quick to the punch and acts before asking questions. Once a junior short course champion, she was talent scouted by the AmaShiru sailing branch, and was quick to make the move, even if sailing under AmaShiru means doing beverage ads that she would really much rather not.</p>

<p>She's reserved and sceptical of attention, which means she hasn't quite taken to the celebrity life that offshore racing entails. She smooths over her social discomfort by being matter-of-fact and agreeable. Or at least, she tries. Many people are intimidated by her, and she can't for the life of her figure out why. Even Xye will often fall in line when she gets pissed, which very few people could claim.</p>

<p>Zera and Xye have a mixed distribution of tasks on the yacht, taking the helm or the mainsheet as the situation requires. She hates being seen in public with Xye when he's being embarrassing. Which is almost any time they're not sailing. His public relations presence is...questionable to her, but who is she to stop him.</p>
