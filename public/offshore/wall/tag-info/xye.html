<h2 class="tag-info-title">Xye</h2>
<ul class="tag-info-list">
    <li>Full name: Xye U.L. (what it stands for is a secret)</li>
    <li>Age: 25</li>
    <li>Pronouns: she/her, he/him</li>
    <li>Birthplace: Anami-sa, Niro</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Xye is the Cloudlanders' nightmare. She's skilled as hell, even haughtier, and flirts with anyone that so much as smiles her way.
    He used to be a local short course champion, before deciding that the excessive regulations were stifling him. Then he signed on with the sailing team of AmaShiru Beveragesâ€”a popular fruit juice brand that's currently branching out into other things, like soda...and offshore racing.
    </p>
<p>The AmaShiru Mirages (consisting of Xye and the up-and-coming star Zera) made a splash at their first race, and have been in the spotlight ever since. They're looking to complete a hat-trick of wins in the Niro-Helfi Race.</p>
<p>
    When she's not racing, Xye still a powerful, petulant, impenetrable wild card, making headlines as easily as flicking her hair. In the interviews, he loves to deliver the meanest, hammiest jabs at the rival team, and Jinai can't help but wonder: is this really necessary? Anqien doesn't mind him...for now.</p>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul class="tag-info-list">
<li>Xye's name is pronounced like the first syllable of "xylophone". But he doesn't care how you pronounce it tbh.</li>
<li>She uses both he/him and she/her very interchangeably and absolutely lives for the confusion it creates when two different people use different pronouns to refer to him in the same conversation.</li>
<li>Xye is associated with neon green, pink, gold and heart motifs. She likes to dress in floral print and eye-hurting colours.</li>
<li>Genderfluid, pansexual and panromantic.</li>
