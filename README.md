# CIRCLEJOURNEY.NET | [Live version](https://rebuild.circlejourney.net)

 **[WIP]** Ongoing work for a Laravel port of my homepage circlejourney.net, uploaded here for portfolio purposes. Currently has:
- MVC for projects, social media links (for the linklist), blogposts, metalinks and artwork - CRUD operations, request authentication, profanity filter middleware
- Laravel Breeze login auth with user "ranks" (currently set directly in the database; TODO: account management form)
