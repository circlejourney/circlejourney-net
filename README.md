 **[WIP]** Ongoing work for a Laravel port of my homepage [circlejourney.net](https://circlejourney.net), uploaded here for portfolio purposes. Currently has:
- Laravel Breeze login auth with user "ranks" (currently set directly in the database; TODO: account management form)
- Models and Controllers for projects, social media links (for the linklist), and blogposts - CRUD operations and authentication of requests
- Various Views to support displaying lists of projects and links!
